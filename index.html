    <h2 >Positive and Negative Aspects about the 2 Visualisations </h2>
    <center><h3 >First visualisation:</h3>
    <p style="max-width:40%;">The visualisation presents themes of Polish books and how they are related to each other, connected via lines. </p>
    <h4 >Positive</h4>

      <p style="max-width:40%;">
        It’s easy to estimate the frequency of each theme by looking at the sizes of the bubbles, with an accompanying legend on the side showing what 200 and 2000 occurrences look like. The legend also shows which colors represent which themes, which is easy to see.
        At first, it’s a bit difficult to see how the themes are actually related, with lots of lines going everywhere, but when hovering over one bubble the lines that are actually connected to that bubble get highlighted, along with the other themes that are related to the theme you hover over, making it easy to see the connections of a theme you are interested in.
      </p>
    </center>
    <h4>Negative</h4>
    <center>
      <p style="max-width:40%;">
        As mentioned before, there are many lines going everywhere, and it looks a bit cluttered. Each time the page is loaded, the graph is randomly positioned, and sometimes overlaps with the legend to the right or ends up outside the box where it’s presented, making it difficult or impossible to read some of the text. There are also areas where there are too many themes in the same space, which also makes text overlap.
        The lines between the themes don’t actually add any value to the visualization when the themes aren’t hovered; everything would look clearer and cleaner if the lines only appeared when you hover the theme.
      </p>
    </center>
    <h3 >Second visualisation:</h3><center>
    <p style="max-width:40%;">This visualisation aims to present how famous creative people structure their day based on 6 categories of daily routines- namely SLEEP, CREATIVE WORK, DAY JOB/ADMIN, FOOD/LEISURE, EXERCISE and OTHER. For each individual a 24h timeline is structured into consecutively aligned colored bars representing the above mentioned activities.</p>
    <h4>Positive</h4>

      <p style="max-width:40%;">
        The visualisation allows for accessing multiple levels of details ( e.g. by hovering over each of the bars we can get more specific information the daily routines of an individual)
        The design also supports filtering the activity categories so we can both have a broad overview of all the categorical data as well as access and compare selected groups or individual categories separately. Lastly, the use of the color is effective since prominent colors are used to highlight the categories that are most likely to be of interest to the user (e.g. “creative work” category is represented using red) while a more neutral color (gray) is used for the less well-defined category “other”.

      </p>

    </center>
    <h4>Negative</h4>
    <center>
      <p style="max-width:40%;">
        The data for each category are fragmented over time and there is no option offered to aggregate them per category for each individual.
        Thus, it is difficult to form a clear idea about the total amount of time each individual spends on a specific activity and compare the differences between different individuals (see image above). Another negative aspect is that it is not easy to compare the daily routines of people that are not positioned close to each other in the row index. For example while we can easily compare the daily routines between Haruki Murakami and Voltaire or Benjamin Franklin, it is quite difficult to compare the routines of Honore de Balzac and Pablo Picasso.

    <h2 > Individual part: Describe an interactive visualization
        that you would like to be able to build after this course has finished </h2>
    <h3> Ioanna Arkoudi:</h3>
    <center>
    <p style="max-width:40%;"> This semester I have taken Interactive Graphs & Interactions as an elective course in DTU and I am currently working on a project that aims to explore the musical preferences of people around the world
    using data from Last.fm (more information about this project are available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko8XdscIJEg"> here</a>). After Interactive Data Exploration finishes, I would
    like to be able to use the collected data and create an interactive graph with the set of the most popular artists around the world as nodes. The edges between the nodes are added by thresholding a similarity score between the artists - that is also provided by Last.fm. A basic description of the interactive visualisation I would like to implement is provided below:
        <ol> <li>The visualisation should include the graph (nodes and edges) with the sizes of the nodes corresponding to their degree - so that the user gets an idea about the significance of each node in the graph and is able to easily spot the hubs. Next to the graph, there should be a section that contains basic stats about the graph (number of nodes, number of edges, average degree etc).</li>
        <li>When the user clicks on a node then the links it creates with the other nodes are highlighted. The content of section that appears next to the graph also changes to include basic information about this node (degree,  betweenness centrality etc). </li>
        <li>I would additionally like to incorporate an on-off "community mode". This mode should be off by default but when the user activates it then the nodes of each community are colorized differently. The section next to the graph now should contain basic information about the community partition of the graph (Modularity score, number of communities, number of nodes in each community etc).</li>
        <li>Lastly, when the user clicks on a node of a community then this community is highlighted and the informative section next to the graph changes again to contain information about the selected community (number of nodes, number of inside links, number of outside links to other communities).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3> Jesper Näsman:</h3>
    <center>
    <p style="max-width:40%;"> I would like do something like using data from <a href="http://politietsregisterblade.dk/">Københavns Stadsarkiv</a> which contains information
    about people who lived in Copenhagen some 100 years ago, along with their relations and professions and all the locations where they lived.
    Addresses in this database also contain coordinates, and it could be interesting to plot data based on neighborhoods of Copenhagen, such as
    the most common professions per neighborhood or how big portion of people in each neighborhood had children, in a similar fashion as
    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/26/upshot/duck-dynasty-vs-modern-family-television-maps.html">
    this</a>.</p></center>

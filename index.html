    <h2 >Positive and Negative Aspects about the 2 Visualisations </h2>
    <h3 >First visualisation:</h3>
    <h4 >Positive</h4>
    It’s easy to estimate the frequency of each theme by looking at the sizes of the bubbles, with an accompanying legend on the side showing what 200 and 2000 occurrences look like. The legend also shows which colors represent which themes, which is easy to see.
At first, it’s a bit difficult to see how the themes are actually related, with lots of lines going everywhere, but when hovering over one bubble the lines that are actually connected to that bubble get highlighted, along with the other themes that are related to the theme you hover over, making it easy to see the connections of a theme you are interested in.
    <h4>Negative</h4>
    As mentioned before, there are many lines going everywhere, and it looks a bit cluttered. Each time the page is loaded, the graph is randomly positioned, and sometimes overlaps with the legend to the right or ends up outside the box where it’s presented, making it difficult or impossible to read some of the text. There are also areas where there are too many themes in the same space, which also makes text overlap.
The lines between the themes don’t actually add any value to the visualization when the themes aren’t hovered; everything would look clearer and cleaner if the lines only appeared when you hover the theme.

    <h4>Positive</h4>

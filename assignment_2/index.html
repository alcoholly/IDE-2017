<h2>Assignment 2</h2>

<h3>(1) Mean temperatures in St. Petersburg by decade</h3>
<svg id="barchart"></svg>



<h2>Motivation, method, conclusions</h2>

The <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/gistemp/show_station.cgi?id=638260630000&dt=1&ds=14">
data</a> we chose is showing temperatures in St. Petersburg from 1880-2017.<br>
Since the raw data isn't proper csv
(the entries are separated by multiple spaces, not comma or tab), we normalized it with sed:<br><br>
<span class="codeblock">sed 's/  */,/g' < station.txt > station_normalized.csv</span>
<br><br>
The first chart is the one we created from scratch (although in order to learn how to
do it we did look on different resources like the lecture notes and the <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/">
Let's make a bar chart</a> site so there are probably some similarities).
Since we wanted to make a bar chart, and since it would just be too crowded using every
year, we wrote a Python script to get the mean temperature for each decade (based on
the mean temperature for each year) instead,
since it still shows that the mean temperature is increasing. Since the current decade is still
"ongoing", we chose to leave it out for the decade data. It also allowed us to work
with different datasets of data so that we don't have to present the exact same data twice.
<br>
<br>
(for the other plot where we show every year we can mention that the variation in temperature
decreases by time)

<h2>Individual part</h2>

<h3>Question 1</h3>

<h3>Question 2 (Jesper)</h3>
I wanted to create a chart similar to <a href="http://prcweb.co.uk/img/radial-bar-sample1.png">this</a>
(but years instead of months that the example is using) but didn't manage to find a good example that
I could understand. I think a circular chart like that would not only look good, but it would make it easy
to see the increase for each year, similar to a bar chart. Hovering over a specific year could provide more
detailed information about that year. Buttons to change the type of visualization could also be added to
change the data that is in the chart from temperature to information such as rainfall or even activities that
correlate with the temperature increase, like the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere.
A function to select a range of years could be a nice feature as well to allow the users to specify themselves
exactly what data to see. <br>
For the bar chart, (1), a nice addition would be to have tooltips that appear on hover, showing the exact
temperature, since you currently only get a hint of the exact temperature; as it is now the bar chart
is better at just showing relative differences between decades.

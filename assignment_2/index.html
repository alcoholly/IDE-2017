<h2>Assignment 2</h2>
<br>

<h3>(1) Mean temperatures per decade</h3>
<div class="svgchart"></div>



<h2>Motivation, method, conclusions</h2>
Since the raw data isn't proper csv
(the entries are separated by multiple spaces), we normalized it with sed:<br><br>
<span class="codeblock">sed 's/  */,/g' < station.txt > station_normalized.csv</span>
<br><br>
The first chart is the one we created from scratch. Since we wanted to make a bar chart,
and since it would just be too crowded using every year, we wrote a Python script to get
the mean temperature for each decade (based on the mean temperature for each year) instead,
since it still shows that the mean temperature is increasing. It also allowed us to work
with different sizes of data so that the two plots aren't too similar.

<h2>Individual part</h2>

<h3>Question 1</h3>

<h3>Question 2 (Jesper)</h3>
I wanted to create a chart similar to <a href="http://prcweb.co.uk/img/radial-bar-sample1.png">this</a>
(but years instead of months that the example is using) but didn't manage to find a good example that
I could understand. I think a circular chart like that would not only look good, but it would make it easy
to see the increase for each year, similar to a bar chart. Hovering over a specific year could provide more
detailed information about that year. Buttons to change the type of visualization could also be added to
change the data that is in the chart from temperature to information such as rainfall or even activities that
correlate with the temperature increase, like the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere.
A function to select a range of years could be a nice feature as well.

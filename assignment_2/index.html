<h2>Assignment 2</h2>
<br>

<h3>Mean temperatures per decade</h3>
<div class="svgchart"></div>



<h2>Motivation, method, conclusions</h2>
The data we chose to work with is the means for every year. Since the raw data isn't proper csv
(the entries are separated by multiple spaces), we normalized it with sed:<br><br>
<span class="codeblock">sed 's/  */,/g' < station.txt > station_normalized.csv</span>
<br><br>
The first chart is a modified version from (url) and the second chart we built on our own. We also tried
implementing a regression line for the first chart but ended up not having enough time to finish that. It
would however have added some value to the chart.
The temperature is, as expected, increasing, and that can clearly be seen in both charts. While we could
have extended the charts by adding the temperature for each months, it would likely just have made the charts
look cluttered and not actually contributed to anything.

<h2>Individual part</h2>

<h3>Question 1</h3>

<h3>Question 2 (Jesper)</h3>
I wanted to create a chart similar to <a href="http://prcweb.co.uk/img/radial-bar-sample1.png">this</a>
(but years instead of months that the example is using) but didn't manage to find a good example that
I could understand. I think a circular chart like that would not only look good, but it would make it easy
to see the increase for each year, similar to a bar chart. Hovering over a specific year could provide more
detailed information about that year. Buttons to change the type of visualization could also be added to
change the data that is in the chart from temperature to information such as rainfall or even activities that
correlate with the temperature increase, like the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere.
A function to select a range of years could be a nice feature as well.
